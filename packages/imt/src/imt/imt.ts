 * of a Merkle tree, and its key feature is its ability to efficiently update the tree

 * In this implementation, the tree is constructed using a fixed {@link IMT#depth}
 * value, and a list of {@link IMT#zeroes} (one for each level) is used to compute the
 * hash of a node when not all of its children are defined. The number of children for each
 * node can also be specified with the {@link IMT#arity} parameter.
